	1.	Design:
	•	Define the structure of a bug (e.g., ID, description, status, severity, etc.).
	•	Decide on the data structures to store bugs (e.g., array, linked list, etc.).
	•	Plan how you’ll manage version control through the command line (e.g., using Git commands).
	2.	Implementation:
	•	Implement functions to add, remove, update, and display bugs.
	•	Integrate version control commands (e.g., commit, push, pull) using system calls or a library like libgit2.
	3.	User Interface:
	•	Design a simple command-line interface for users to interact with the bug tracker and version control features.
	4.	Testing:
	•	Test your bug tracker system thoroughly to ensure it handles various scenarios correctly.
	•	Test version control commands to verify they integrate seamlessly with the bug tracker.
